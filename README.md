## Description
A small website using express.js and handlebars engine. The website is mainly
used for practice with design and adding suttle animations. Using express to
help route and handle the different pages of the website it it fast and easy for
user to use. Handlebars was also used it also helps speed up the rendering of
the website and maintain the quality of animations and design changes with
different screen sizes. 

The website is also responsive and from 4k to small phone screens it will work
with any screen size. Some animations still need to be ploish at certain screen
sizes but that is planned for later. A redesign is also in plans for shop page
and the trainers page.

## Tools
The website is using express.js to handle the routes and any future route
planned whihc orginizes the pages of the website.

Handlebars is also use which was planned to render an infinte amount of pages
for product and information, but that is still planned. It also helps speed up
the rendering of the website, by only sending certain parts of some of the
pages.

NPM is used to manage the dependencies of the website so I can do more than just
render basici html.

Firebase is used to host and manage the website online so other can view and use
the website.
